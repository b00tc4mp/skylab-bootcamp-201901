# OSI

## Abstraction of an Operative System Interface

#### Description

In OSI the logged in user has it's own Desktop, where he/she is able to create "note-like" files and store them in folders. The user can arrange the folders and files with a Drag & Drop in desktop at his will, thus simulating a filesystem.

The user also has a ToDos-like tool, a clock and a toolbar embedded in desktop. The toolbar contains launchers for a calculator tool, a notepad-like text editor and settings for the operative system.

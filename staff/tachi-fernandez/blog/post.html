                    This was calculated by a team of British researchers who attached colored LED lights to hundreds of these animals and tracked their movements over a period of 24 hours.

                    The scientists observed that the gastropods were able to explore an average-sized garden in the United Kingdom in a single night.
                    
                    But the speed of snails is not good news: researchers believe that fast snails are spreading a deadly parasite for dogs.
                    
                    In recent years, humid British summers have been breeding grounds for snails.
                    
                    According to the Royal Society of Horticulture, the population of these animals increased by 50% in the last year.
                    
                    And besides being a plague for gardeners, they can also spread a parasite called Angiostrongylus vasorum.
                    
                    These nematode worms pose a particularly dangerous threat to dogs, which can become infected by accidentally eating slugs or snails.

                    Snails can reach a speed of one meter per hour.
                    A campaign funded by the veterinary branch of the Bayer company commissioned scientists from the University of Exeter in England to measure the scale of the threat posed by these parasites.

                    The researchers tried to follow the movements of the snails inside a garden.
                    
                    To do this, they placed small colored LED lights around 450 snails and used ultraviolet paint to track their movements.
                    
                    They observed that these animals were able to travel distances of up to 25 meters in 24 hours.
                    
                    "They're so slow that people do not even think they're moving, but it turns out they do, and they can go a long way in one night," explains Dave Hodgson, who led the study.

                    The parasite Angiostrongylus vasorum can be lethal to dogs.
                    According to the expert, his work indicates that snails pose a growing threat to pets.
                    
                    "They are not just lettuce chewers, they carry parasites that can kill dogs," warns Hodgson, since Angiostrongylus vasorum is an endemic disease in the United Kingdom.

                    In this study, scientists were surprised to see that many snails followed the sluggish trail of others. According to Hodgson, this is related to energy conservation.
                    
                    "We know that snails use 40% of their energy producing slime."
                    
                    "And if you have the opportunity, a snail will prefer to follow a trail that another left, it is a way of cheating similar to the tunnel of aerodynamic suction", explains the scientist.

        In this post we are going to talk about the importance of position in a
        paddle field. If you are a beginner you will be able to acquire some
        notions about the different locations on the track, and if you are an
        experienced player it will not be bad for you to remember certain
        aspects that are sometimes forgotten or erroneously modified by customs
        in the game.

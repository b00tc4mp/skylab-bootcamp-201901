# ARRAY FUNCTIONS

Diferent array functions simulating the native array methods

### ARRAY FUNCTIONS LIST
Function | Description
-------- | -----------
*isArray* | determines whether the passed value is an Array.
*concat* | used to merge two or more arrays and/or values. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.
*every* | tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
*fill** | fills (modifies) all the elements of an array from a start index (default zero) to an end index (default array length) with a static value. It returns the modified array.
*filter* | creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
*find* | returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise ***undefined*** is returned.
*forEach** | executes a provided function once for each array element.
*includes* | determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning **true** or **false** as appropriate.
*indexOf** | returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or **-1** if it is not present.
*join** | creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array, separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.
*lastIndexOf** | returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or **-1** if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at **fromIndex**.
*map** | creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
*reduce** | executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting in a single output value.
*reduceRight** | applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from right-to-left) to reduce it to a single value.
*reverse* | reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first.
*shift** |
*slice** |
*some* | tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. This method returns false for any condition put on an empty array.
*sort** | sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
*splice** |

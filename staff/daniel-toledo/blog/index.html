            <p>Willows, also called sallows and osiers, form the genus Salix, around 400 species
                of deciduous trees and shrubs, found primarily on moist soils in cold and temperate 
                regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved 
                shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow 
                (from Old English sealh, related to the Latin word salix, willow).

            <p>An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family, Fagaceae. 
                There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name "oak" also appears 
                in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus, as well as in those 
                of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta and the Casuarinaceae.

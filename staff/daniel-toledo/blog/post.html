                In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, 
                supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of
                 a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants
                  that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic 
                  group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk 
                  and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be 
                  long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In wider definitions, the taller palms, 
                  tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. 
                  It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. </p>

        <p> A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. 
            This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials 
            from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves 
            as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor 
            the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller 
            branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars
             by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.</p>
               
         <p>Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, 
             instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns 
             produce spores instead.</p>

                Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide
                 from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a 
                 habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats 
                 in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit 
                 for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared 
                 to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, 
                 trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of 
                 the world's mythologies.

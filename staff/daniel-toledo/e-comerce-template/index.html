            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <img src="http://www.astronoo.com/images/planetes/mercure/mercure-messenger.jpg" alt="Mercury">
            <p>
            Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s moon. It is the closest
            planet to the sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter. <br> <br>
            Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with
            craters. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple. <br> <br>
            This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to
            make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take
            very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on
            Mercury, you’d have a birthday every three months! <br> <br>
            A day on Mercury is not likea day here on Earth. For us, the sun rises and sets each and every day. Because Mercury 
            has a slow spin and short year, it takes a long time for the sun to rise and set there. 
            Mercury only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days! Isn't that weird?

            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <img src="https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA3NS83MDEvb3JpZ2luYWwvdmVudXMtY2xvdWRzLWpheGEuanBn" alt="Venus">
            <p>
            Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun, it is still the hottest. It has a thick atmosphere full of the
            greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid. The gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In
            fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like lead would be puddles of melted liquid. <br> <br>
            Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just
            a little bit bigger. <br> <br>
            Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. And its rotation is very
            slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because it's so close to the sun, a year goes by fast. It
            takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than
            a year on Venus. <br> <br>
            Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the sun rises and sets
            once each day. But on Venus, the sun rises every 117 Earth days. That means the sun rises two times during each year on
            Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus! And because Venus rotates backwards, the sun rises in the west
            and sets in the east. <br> <br>
            Just like Mercury, Venus doesn’t have any moons.

                <p>
                    Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys,
                    canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
                    <br> <br>
                    Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us
                    from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.
                    <br> <br>
                    Since we live here, you might think we know all there is to know about Earth. Not at all, actually! We have a lot we
                    can learn about our home planet. Right now, there are many satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures and measurements.
                    This is how we can learn more about weather, oceans, soil, climate change, and many other important topics.

                <h1>Mars</h1>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg" alt="Mars">
                <p>
                    Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of
                    rusty iron in the ground.
                    <br><br>
                    Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of
                    carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
                    <br><br>
                    There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some Martian
                    hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.
                    <br><br>
                    Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could support
                    life now or in the future.

                <p>
                        Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start
                        burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for
                        hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about
                        the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.

                <h1>Saturn</h1>

                <p>
                Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of
                groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a
                ball of hydrogen and helium.
                <br><br>
                When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. At first he
                thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the
                rings of Saturn.

                <h1>Uranus</h1>
                <img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/files/2016/03/neptune1.jpg" alt="Uranus">
                <p>
                Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and
                helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.
                <br><br>
                Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to
                see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus
                rotates on its side.

                <p>
                Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far
                from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane
                over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune
                the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
